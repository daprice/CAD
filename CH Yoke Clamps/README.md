# Better Clamps for CH Products Flight Sim Peripherals

<i>"Bada-climp, bada-clamp!"</i>

The stock clamps on the CH Products Flight Sim Yoke and Throttle Quadrant only work on very thick desks unless you use some kind of spacer. They also don't hold the yoke very securely, allowing it to tip forward. These clamps fix that.

Preparation: 3D print two of the clamp.stl model in some kind of durable hard plastic such as PLA, PETG, ASA, ABS, or similar (3+ shells and > 20% infill recommended; make sure the printing temperature is calibrated for good layer adhesion). Optionally, cover the gripping surface of the clamps using rubber or other soft material to increase grip and prevent damage to the underside of your desk.

1. Fully unscrew the clamps from the bottom of the yoke using the hand screws.
2. Pull out the existing clamp "feet" that you removed the screws from (might take some wiggling, they're a tight fit).
3. Insert these clamps that you 3D printed into the holes on the bottom of the yoke.
4. Screw the screws back in partially.
5. Attach the yoke to your desk or table and tighten the screws.
