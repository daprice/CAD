# Customizable fan grill using built-in snap pins to attach to your fan

The included STL fits most 120mm fans; you can clip this directly onto most fans without needing screws. SCAD source file included so you can make grills for other size fans; this requires a pin connector library ([tbuser's Pin Connectors](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10541) or [whpthomas' PLA Pin Connectors](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:130879)) as `pins/pins.scad` in the same parent directory as `screwless_fan_grill.scad`.
